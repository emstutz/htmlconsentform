<div>You are invited to participate in a research study conducted by Dr. Ulrich Mayr of the Department of
    Psychology from the University of Oregon. This study is funded by the National Institutes of Health. In our
    study we hope to learn about the processes involved in the regulation of thought and action. Thank you for
    considering participating in this experiment.
    If you decide to participate, you will be asked to complete portions of standardized psychometric measures
    (tests aimed at quantifying your knowledge, skills or abilities in testing areas) as well as performing simple tasks on the computer.
    The computerized portion of this experiment may involve speaking words, pressing keys, and/or touching a touch-sensitive screen in response to objects or words
    appearing on the monitor. In addition, eye-tracking equipment may be used to record your eye movements
    while performing the task, and/or a measurement device in form of a belt around your torso to assess your
    breathing rhythm. The procedure involves minimal risk of discomfort or stress. </div>

    <input type="checkbox" id="rate&in" name="rate&in" value="Hourly rate + Extra incentives">
    <label for="rate&in"><b>Hourly rate + Extra incentives:</b></label><div>In addition to the hourly rate, participants will receive small rewards for
        correct answers, in the form of money (to yourself or to charity), food, or images. Reward compensation will be
        linked to random trial numbers and will result in the addition of 1-50 cents per correct trial for monetary
        incentives. Because you will not know which trials are linked to rewards it is important that you do your best on
        each one. The amount of each reward will be randomly determined by the computer, with the total appearing on
        the final screen.</div>
    <b>You can discontinue participation at any time during the experiment. If you discontinue participation in
    the middle of the study, you will receive compenstion for the actual time completed, rounded up to the next 15 minutes. 
    If you keep your scheduled appointment but choose not to participate in the study at all, you will receive compensation for the first 15 minutes of the study.</b>

        <p>By participating you help us to understand the basic mechanisms involved in the control of thought and
            action.  By understanding such basic processes, we are in a better position to help people overcoming unwanted,
            automatic thoughts. However, we cannot guarantee that you personally will receive any benefits from this
            research.</p>

            No information that is obtained in connection with this study will be identified with you.   Your
            confidentiality will be assured by associating your data with a code and a number specifying the experimental
            conditions that you are in, instead of with your name. 
            <b>Your participation is voluntary.  Your decision whether or not to participate will not affect your 
            relationship with the UO Psychology Department or the UO Linguistics Department. If you decide to

            research study is completely independent of diagnostic activities, treatment, or support you receive by the health
            care provider.  No information about your participation in the study (including, whether or not you participated)
            will be revealed to the health care provider.</p>
